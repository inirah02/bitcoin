## Data Collection
- Utilizing an instant data scraper API to extract price values from prominent cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Coinbase.

## Preprocessing
- Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to remove noise, handle missing values, and ensure consistency.

## Feature Engineering
- Selecting relevant features such as historical price data, trading volume, and market sentiment indicators to enhance model performance.
  - **Timestamp:** Date and time at which the price data was recorded.
  - **Bitcoin Price:** Value of Bitcoin at the specified timestamp.
  - **Additional Features:** Other relevant features such as trading volume, open, high, low, close, adj close, volume.
  - **Data Quality:** Ensuring data integrity and reliability through rigorous data cleaning and validation processes.
  - **Historical Data:** Historical Bitcoin price data spanning a specific timeframe, typically ranging from several months to years.
  - **Real-Time Updates:** Continuously update the dataset with the latest Bitcoin price values to ensure the model's relevance and accuracy.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- The ground truth values refer to the actual observed Bitcoin prices over a period of time (several years). Validating these values involves comparing the predicted Bitcoin prices generated by the LSTM model with the actual observed prices.

### LSTM Model Integration with Sentiment Analysis
- Integrating sentiment analysis from social media forums like Twitter and Reddit with LSTM networks.
- Results showcase the prevalence of neutral sentiment, alongside a notable positive sentiment bias, indicating a favorable outlook towards Bitcoin.
- Model performance:
  - Accuracy: 0.8580
  - Precision: 0.8849
  - Recall: 0.8345
  - F1 Score: 0.8590

## Dataset Description
- The dataset comprises data collected from 2018 to 2023, encompassing a diverse range of information related to Bitcoin.
- User sentiments were derived from social media forums like Twitter and Reddit.
- Attributes include:
  - User details: user_name, user_location, user_description, user_created, user_followers, user_friends, user_favourites, user_verified.
  - Tweet details: date, text, hashtags, source, is_retweet.
- The dataset aims to analyze semantic metadata expressed in online conversations about Bitcoin, providing valuable insights into public opinion and market trends surrounding cryptocurrency.

### Bitcoin Price Dataset
- The dataset tracks Bitcoin prices by scraping attributes from cryptocurrency exchange platforms.
- Columns include:
  - Date: Date of each trading session.
  - Open: Starting price for the session.
  - High: Maximum value attained by Bitcoin during a trading session.
  - Low: Minimum value reached by Bitcoin within the same period.
  - Close: Price at the session's end.
  - Adj Close: Adjusted closing price, considering corporate actions.
  - Volume: Total number of Bitcoin units traded, indicating market liquidity.

Together, these columns present a comprehensive picture of Bitcoin's price dynamics, aiding in trend analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making within the cryptocurrency market.
